		<p id="rasheed">Rasheed is a rising Senior at The Berkeley Carroll School. He is interested in Computer Science, Foreign Relations and Engineering. Previously, he has participated in All Star Code's 'Start-Up in a Day' workshop. This was his initial introduction to coding and has inspired him to progress in his Computer Science learning. Before this program, he has not had any extensive coding experience. All Star Code has allowed him to move forward in his programming abilities. He has progressed to creating his own website along with Devon Howell which is a component of his Final Project. His intention at the end of this program is to continue learning, using the foundations taught during the All Star Code Summer Intensive. This program has afforded him the opportunity to potentially invest in Computer Science as a professional career.</p>
