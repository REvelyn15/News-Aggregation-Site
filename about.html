		<p>Rasheed is a rising Senior at The Berkeley Carroll School. He is interested in Computer Science, Foreign Relations and Engineering. Previously, he has participated in All Star Code's 'Start-Up in a Day' workshop. This was his initial introduction to coding and has inspired him to progress in his Computer Science learning. Before this program, he has not had any extensive coding experience. All Star Code has allowed him to move forward in his programming abilities. He has progressed to creating his own website along with Devon Howell which is a component of his Final Project. His intention at the end of this program is to continue learning, using the foundations taught during the All Star Code Summer Intensive. This program has afforded him the opportunity to potentially invest in Computer Science as a professional career.</p>

		<p>Devon is a rising senior at the Bronx High School of Science. He is deeply interested in linguistics and is currently studying French, German, and Spanish. After seeing his brother learn to play the violin, Devon cultivated an appreciation for music. He sings frequently and has began to learn to play piano.<br> In his sophomore year of high school, Devon began coding and instantly fell in love with it. He has coded in Java, Javascript, as well as a bit of Ruby and Python. He has taken AP Java and plans to pursue app and game development.<br>During All Star Code, Devon developed his peer programming skills as previously he had only coded alone. He programmed games such as "Don't Touch the White Tiles" and helped others to develop their skills as programmers.</p>
